2. Add the description to main bccp repository in subsites.txt

3. Find the most recent Google Drive folder, copy the form and tables, get new URL

4. Update the content of the branch, with links of the new form

5. add the link to the branch on bccp.berkeley.edu/{branchname} to the workshops
   page website

For editing, you want to start by cloning a branch directly.
